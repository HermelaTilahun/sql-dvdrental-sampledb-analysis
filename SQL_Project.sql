-------------------------------Section 1: DML (Data Manipulation Language) – 5 Questions--------------------------------

=========================================================================================================================


________________________________________________________DML#1____________________________________________________________

1--Insert a New Customer Record:Insert a new customer with appropriate details (e.g., first name, last name, email, address, city) into the customer table.

/* Our SQL code performs a series of database operations within a single transaction.it executes a transaction that 
adds a new country, city, address, and customer to their respective tables in a database. It ensures data consistency 
by linking the new entries appropriately across tables.The transaction is then committed to make the changes permanent.
*/

/*
BEGIN TRANSACTION
This starts a transaction. A transaction is a way to group multiple SQL operations so that they either all succeed or all fail. 
If something goes wrong during any of the operations, none of the changes will be saved to the database.
COMMIT TRANSACTION
This commits the transaction, making all changes made during the transaction permanent. 
If the transaction had failed or been rolled back, none of the changes would be applied.*/


BEGIN TRANSACTION; --Begins a transaction to ensure all inserts are completed together.

INSERT INTO country (country_id, country, last_update)
VALUES (120, 'ETHIOPIA', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);--Inserts a new country (Ethiopia) into the country table.

INSERT INTO city (city_id, city, country_id, last_update)
VALUES (606, 'Baltimore', 120, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);--Inserts a new city (Baltimore) into the city table, linked to the new country.

INSERT INTO address (address_id, address, address2, district, city_id, postal_code, phone, last_update)--Inserts a new address into the address table.
VALUES (618, '123 dale st', '', 'Barris3', 399, '21201', '8322061177', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

INSERT INTO customer (customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, email, address_id, activebool, create_date, last_update, active)
VALUES (620, 1, 'Teka4', 'Adane5', 'tekal5@yahoo.com', 616, TRUE, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 1);--618>>619----Inserts a new customer into the 
--customer table, linked to the new address.
 
COMMIT TRANSACTION; --Commits the transaction.


------------------------------------------------Verifing the insertions------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT *
FROM country
WHERE country_id = 120


SELECT *
FROM address
WHERE address_id= 618
___________________________________________________________DML#2_____________________________________________________________________________

2--Update Customer Email: Update the email address of an existing customer by their customer ID.

/* Our sql code to the question above updates the email address of a specific customer in the customer table 
by setting the email column to 'MAerie@gmail.com'. 
The update is targeted at the customer identified by customer_id 600, ensuring that only this particular record is modified.*/

UPDATE customer --'UPDATE' specifies that we're modifying data in the 'customer' table.
SET email='MAerie@gmail.com'--defines the change we're making. We're set the 'email' column to a new value 'MAerie@gmail.com'.
WHERE customer_id=600;--Identifies which customer to update.

___________________________________________________________DML#3_______________________________________________________________________________

3--Delete a Rental Record: Delete a rental record from the rental table by specifying the rental ID.

/*In summary, our SQL quary below deletes a single record from the rental table, specifically the one with a rental_id of 7. 
It's a targeted deletion that affects only one row, leaving all other records in the table untouched.*/

DELETE-- remove records from a database table
FROM rental----Specifies the table from which you want to delete records.
WHERE rental_id = 7; --Determines which record will be deleted.

-----Testing if Specified record is deleted-------

SELECT * 
FROM rental;
_________________________________________________________DML#4____________________________________________________________________

4--Increase Film Rental Duration: Update the rental duration of a specific film in the film table, increasing it by 2 days.

/*Our SQL code below updates a specific record in the film table by increasing the rental_duration by 2 days. 
The change is applied exclusively to the film identified by film_id '133', ensuring that only this particular
record is modified while all other records remain unchanged.*/


UPDATE film --Specifies the film table is to be updated.
SET rental_duration=rental_duration + 2 --Defines what needs to be changed,rental_duration is being increased by 2 days.
WHERE film_id='133'; --Determines which specific record will be updated. the film with film_id of '133' is being updated.

-----Testing if Specified record is updated -------

SELECT * 
FROM film;


_________________________________________________________DML#5___________________________________________________________________

5--Insert a New Film Record: Insert a new film with appropriate details (e.g., title, description, rental rate, length) into the film table.

/*In summary,our SQL code below inserts a new record into the film table for a movie titled "Ethiopia hagrie," 
detailing its attributes such as description, release year, rental information, and rating. 
The film_id is set to 1006, the last_update field is populated with the current timestamp, and special features are listed as '{Trailers}'.*/

INSERT INTO film(film_id,title,description,release_year,language_id,rental_duration,rental_rate,length,replacement_cost,rating,last_update,special_features,fulltext)
VALUES(1006,'Ethiopia hagrie','A Amazing ethiopian history',2024,1,3,10.99,120,20.99,'G',Now(),'{Trailers}',null) --inserts a new row into the film table.

       ------------Verify if the new film was successfully inserted into the database-------------------
	   
SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE film_id=1006;
